# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input, specifically in this case, user IDs.  The provided `bug.js` file contains a vulnerable route that attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without any validation, leading to potential errors if the ID is not a number.

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, adds input validation to prevent these errors.  This highlights the importance of robust error handling in production-ready applications.
